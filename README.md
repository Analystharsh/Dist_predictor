# Dist_predictor
 Established a statistically independent linear relationship of response variable(distance) with the predictor variable(speed). After formation of model predicted the response by giving some predictor value.</br></br>
 
## First plotted a scatter plot to visually understand the relationship between predictor and response variable through scatter.smoth() function</br>

## Tested for any outlier observation if present in data and then plotted a box plot. We had done it for both the predictor variable and response variable. </br>

## Built a linear relationship using lm() function and calculated coffecient for linear relationship.</br>

## Finally Visualise the regression graphically by plotting a chart.</br>
